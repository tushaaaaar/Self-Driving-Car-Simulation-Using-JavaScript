# Self Driving Car Simulation Using JavaScript
With the assistance of JavaScript, I'm developing a car model based on neural networks. This model is designed to learn how to drive the car and avoid accidents caused by obstacles on the road.

I followed a tutorial from a YouTube video by freeCodingCamp.org, but instead of simply copying and pasting the code, I took the time to understand the concepts behind neural networks and the other methods employed in this model.
<br>
This project has been incredibly enjoyable and has provided me with valuable learning experiences.
